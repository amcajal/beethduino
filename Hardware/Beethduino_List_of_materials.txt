COMPONENTS
===========

LIST OF COMPONENTS USED IN THE PROTOYPE (MAY DIFFER FROM THE ONES USED IN A FINAL PRODUCT):

    - 1 * Sunfounder UNO R3 Board (or a compatible Arduino Board).
    - 1 * USB data cable.
    - 1 * Breadboard.
    - 1 * Active Buzzer.
    - 1 * LCD - LCD1602.
    - 1 * Potentiometer 50 kOhm (Only used in Protoype to adjust LCD).
    - 5 * Resistor 10 kOhm.
    - 5 * Button.
    - Several jumper wires (30 min. in the proposed arrangement).

To build final product, include Power Plug-in or Battery, together with
custom plastic case to protect the components. Recommended to turn
the prototype into a PCB, to minimize size and material.
