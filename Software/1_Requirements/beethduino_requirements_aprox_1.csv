REQ_ID;REQ_TEXT;
1;Beethduino shall reproduce the behaviour of a metronome, by generating signals -accoustic or visual- at a specific rate, in order to keep a constant pulse to execute a musical piece.;
2;Beethduino shall be based on Arduino technology.;
3;Beethduino shall produce sound signals that represents the constant pulse.;
4;"Beethduino shall work with the Beats Per Minute concept: number of sonoric signals -""bips""- produced in a minute-60 seconds-. ";
5;Beethduino shall turn on when connected to a power supply, and turn off when disconnected from the power supply.;
6;"Beethduino shall turn on in the following initial state:
- Buzzer state: Muted.
- BPM value: 60";
7;Beethduino shall allow the user to mute or unmute the Buzzer.;
8;Beethduino shall generate sounds WHEN the buzzer is unmutted AND stay silent WHEN the buzzer is muted.;
9;Beethduino shall allow the user to specify the BPM -beats per minute-.;
10;"Beethduino shall establish the following boundaries to the BPM value:
- Upper Level: 300 BPM.
- Lower level: 1 BPM.";
11;Beethduino shall generate sounds -from the buzzer- at the frequency established by the BPM number.;
12;"Beethduino shall provide constant feedback of the state if the system, regards to:
- Current BPM value.
- Current Buzzer state.";
13;Beethduino shall allow the user to restart the system to its initial state.;
14;"Beethduino shall interface with the user using the following components:
- Buzzer: sound signals.
- LCD: textual information.
- Buttons: execution of operations.";
15;"Beethduino shall print in the LCD, as plain text, information about the state of the system:
- Current BPM value.
- Current Buzzer state.";
16;Beethduino shall detect button pulsations from the user AND execute the required operation.;
17;"Beethduino shall turn on in the following initial state:
- Buzzer state: Muted
- BPM: 60
- Modify mode: ADD";
18;"Beehtduino shall operate the BPM in the following modes -Modify Modes-:
- ADD: BPM number is increased.
- SUB: BPM number is decreased.";
19;"Beethduino shall modify the BPM value using ONLY the following fixed amounts:
- 1 unit
- 10 units";
20;"Beethduino shall modify the BPM value following this logic:
- IF (Modify mode == ADD) THEN
    - Increase BPM value
- ELSE IF (Modify mode == SUB) THEN
    - Decrease BPM value";
21;"Beethduino shall increase the BPM value following this logic:
- IF Modify mode == ADD THEN
    - IF selected amount == 1 unit THEN
        BPM = BPM + 1
    - ELSE IF selected amount == 10 THEN
        BPM = BPM + 10";
22;"Beethduino shall show the current state of the system, regarding to:
- Buzzer state: Muted or Unmutted.
- BPM: current beats per minute at which the buzzer generates sound.
- Modify mode: ADD or SUB";
23;Beethduino shall detect user actions through buttons.;
24;Beethduino shall be composed by the components specified in the LIST_OF_MATERIALS.txt;
